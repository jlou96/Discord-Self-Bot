# Discord-Self-Bot
This is a small fork of DiNitride's Discord-Self-Bot. In this fork, I aim to introduce functionality that logs and downloads image files shared between you and a friend via DM. As with the original, [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) is required.

The command syntax is `self.dl_images n`, where `n` is the number of most recent messages that you want to log (may or may not include image files).
